Description
HTTP request handlers should not perform expensive operations such as accessing the file system, executing an operating system command or interacting with a database without limiting the rate at which requests are accepted. Otherwise, the application becomes vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks where an attacker can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive by issuing a large number of requests at the same time.
